=head1 NAME

Net::AS2::PSGI - AS2 Protocol Plack application

=head1 VERSION

This documentation is for AS2 Protocol Version 1.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ### Create an AS2 PSGI Server

    my $view_app   = Net::AS2::PSGI->to_view_app();

    my $server_app = Net::AS2::PSGI->to_server_app();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines an AS2 Protocol compliant Plack application.

The AS2 Protocol is specified by RFC 4130. This protocol defines a
secure peer-to-peer data transfer with receipt using HTTP. The receipt
is called a Message Disposition Notification (MDN) and is specified by
RFC 3798.

The Public certificates between each partnership are exchanged
independently. i.e. The AS2 protocol does not allow for the public
certificate to be downloaded, they must be exchanged before any AS2
communication can occur.

Implementations of the AS2 Protocol extend the original RFC 4130 to
allow for transfer over HTTPS and use of newer signing algorithms,
e.g. the SHA-2 family.

The AS2 Protocol defines two modes, Synchronous and Asynchronous.

The supported AS2 Protocol version is 1.0. Version 1.1 (compression)
is not supported.

=over 4

=item Synchronous

In this mode the data is POSTed from the sender to the receiver and
the response is the MDN receipt.

=item Asynchronous

In this mode the data is POSTed from the sender to the receiver but
the response only confirms the data was sent.

The receiver on completion of receiving the data, POSTs the MDN
receipt for the data back to the sender.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The server uses the following directories.

=over 4

=item certificate_dir

This directory contains Private and Public Certificate pairings and
the Public Certificate for each defined Partnership.

For security, this directory and the files within it should not be
world readable.

An alternative, is to either supply the key and certificate text
strings directly in the L<Net::AS2> hash or supply an alternative
directory per partnership, using the C<CertificateDirectory>
L<Net::AS2> hash key.

=item partnership_dir

This directory contains JSON files that each define a partnership
between two AS2 Protocol Servers.

Subdirectories may be used, with the whole relative path being used to
define the partnership name.

For security, this directory and the files within it should not be
world readable.

The partnership file contains the key names defined in L<Net::AS2>, along with the following additions:

=over 4

=item FileHandlerClass

A Perl class that can process the files being sent and received via the AS2 protocol.
See L<Net::AS2::PSGI::FileHandler>, default is "Net::AS2::PSGI::FileHandler".

=back

=item file_dir

This directory will contain either files received from a partnership
transfer or an MDN after sending data to a partnership.

For security, this directory and the files within it should not be
world readable.

The directory structure is as follows:

=over 4

=item partnership

The subdirectory structure is created and named after the partnership
file (without the .json extension). For security, this directory
structure is created with owner read/write only.

The files being transferred between this partnership are then stored
under the following directories:

=over 4

=item SENDING

Files here are being sent to the partner, but no receipt has been received yet.

=item SENT

Files here have been sent to the partner and a receipt has been received.

=item RECEIVING

Files here are being received from the partner, but no receipt has been sent yet.

=item RECEIVED

Files here have been received from the partner and a receipt has been sent.

    return;
}

=item view_psgi ()

Class Method returning a PSGI application for viewing partnerships.

This app is B<not> part of the AS2 specification. It may be useful
for checking end-to-end access between partners and confirming
partnership configurations.

=head1 API METHODS

All API methods receive a Plack request as their one and only argument.

=over 4

=item send ( request )

To send data to a partner, a POST request is created with a URL of the form /send/C<partnership>

The data is sent as the content of the POST request along with the following headers:

=over 4

=item MessageId

The AS2 Message ID.

The Message ID is validated to ensure it conforms to RFC 822.

In Asynchronous mode, the received MDN will include this value as the
C<Original Message ID>, thus tying the two independent POST requests
(send and MDN receipt) together, to complete the transfer.

=item Content-Type

The Content-Type of the data being sent.

=item Subject

I<Optional.>
The subject is an arbitrary brief one-line string. Default is "AS2 Message".

=item Filename

I<Optional.>
Sets the Content-Disposition filename. Default is "payload".

=item receive ( request )

To receive data from a partner, a POST request is received via a URL of the form /receive/C<partnership>

The data is received as the content of the POST request along with the following headers:

=over 4

=item Message-Id

The AS2 Message ID.

The Message ID is validated to ensure it conforms to RFC 2822.

=item Content-Type

The Content-Type of the data being received.

=item AS2-Version

The AS2 Protocol version, it should be in the form 1.x. Only 1.0 is supported.

See RFC 4130 for further details about the different version numbers.

=item AS2-From

The partner's AS2 ID.

This value should match the PartnerId in the C<partnership.json> file.

=item AS2-To

The receiver's (i.e. this application's) AS2 ID.

This value should match the MyId in the C<partnership.json> file.

=item Disposition-Notification-Options

I<Optional> This header is only defined if digital signatures are requested.

This header contains the requirements for the digital signature.
An example is:

 signed-receipt-protocol=required, pkcs7-signature; signed-receipt-micalg=required, sha256

=item Receipt-Delivery-Option

I<Optional> This header is only defined for Asynchronous mode.

This header defines a URL for the receiver to POST the MDN receipt to,
once the data has been received.

=over 4

=item MessageId

The AS2 Message ID.

The Message ID is validated to ensure it conforms to RFC 2822.

=back

In the RECEIVING directory, the file containing the saved MDN state of
the given Message ID is read and an MDN response is created from the
content. The MDN response is POSTed to the partner.

If the POST fails, the POST response code and content is stored in a
file called C<Message-Id>.C<Timestamp: %F-%H-%M-%S>.mdn-failed in the
RECEIVING directory and the POST response code is returned.

Otherwise, the data file is moved from the RECEIVING directory to
RECEIVED and the MDN state file is moved from the RECEIVING directory
to RECEIVED and renamed to have a .sent extension.  If the MDN message
is not indicating success, the data filename is also renamed to have a
.failed extension.

=item MDNreceive ( request )

Receives an MDN receipt from a partner.

The POST request is received via a URL of the form

The received MDN is decoded.

If the receipt is for a successful transfer, the Original Message ID
is extracted and the file in the SENDING directory is moved to the
SENT directory and its contents replaced with the decoded MDN details.

Otherwise, the MDN details are stored in SENDING directory with a
filename called UNKNOWN.MDN.C<Message-Id> with a 200 HTTP response
being returned.

=head1 EXAMPLES

This module has an /examples directory. It contains an example PSGI
application, its base configuration file, a systemd service for
starman and an nginx conf file with SSL configurations.  There is also
some basic configuration files to get you started with partnering up
with an instance of L<https://github.com/phax/as2-server>.

The module's /t testing directory, includes test cases that forks AS2
L<Plack::Test> applications, and then tests transferring files between
using AS2 synchronous and AS2 asynchronous transfer modes.

=item Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary and LF line-endings

During testing against an Oracle B2B implementation, an issue with
Digital Signatures was found. The Oracle instance was sending data
with LF line-endings using binary Content-Transfer-Encoding.

The L<Crypt::SMIME> validation failed the signature check.

A similar scenario occurred when testing with RSSBus software. In that
case, just sending the file with CRLF line-endings was successful.  It
was not possible to test whether the same workaround would work with
Oracle B2B. Another possibility is to configure sending/receiving base64
Content-Transfer-Encoding requests.

The issue may lie in the OpenSSL canonicalisation code when handling
binary Content-Transfer-Encoding data. It appears to incorrectly apply
canonicalisation of binary specified data.  (OpenSSL version 1.1.0g).

=item AS2 1.1 compression

The AS2 Protocol Version 1.1 (compression) is not supported.

=item Filesystem initiated interface

Unlike other AS2 software, this module does not provide a means to
send file to partners simply by copying a file to a designated 'send'
directory. That functionality could probably be created by combining
L<AnyEvent>, L<Twiggy> and this PSGI interface.
